          <p>
            Trust and respect are things that have to be earned. Awareness comes from being top of mind. These should all be the end goals of your marketing strategy, from SEO and content marketing to social media and email.<br>
            Your company’s About Us page is another opportunity to tell a story that will help you stick in your customer’s minds. (And as Blue Acorn’s study proves, it’s also an opportunity for a sale.)
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            Although everyone knows that users prefer images to text, it’s not as easy as just putting a bunch of pictures on your About Us page (although, as you will see, that definitely helps) and moving on to the next project. While creating an innovative page is hard work and can be time consuming, it can build the trust and respect of a potential customer, thus tipping the scale greatly tipped in your favor.
            <br><br>
            So how do the best companies do it right?
            <br><br>
            We have taken a look at 50 different pages that excel. Each have features you can learn and modify for your own site.
            <br><br>
            In addition, we also put together an infographic that breaks down the science behind a great About Us page.

              <p>
                <b>Build Trust Through Photos</b> – Showing photos of the founders or team members helps convey that the company is full of real, relatable people that you can trust with your business.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Clear Value Proposition</b> – Providing a simple, clear value proposition is the easiest way to get a user’s attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Establish Credibility</b> – To appear credible in the eyes of your customers, you can show off reviews, testimonials, or if you are a web design site, showcase your skills on the page itself.
